Open Contracting Data
===================

We are trying to provide public data on government contracting and to build open 
standards on its publication. This enables everyone to better track and 
understand where and how money flows around the world.

Four Initiatives for this sprint:

    - Datamap Landscape
    - Data Comparison
    - Usecase Documentation
    - Standard Colaborator

Resources:
    
    - Hackpads with more information: https://opencontractingdata.hackpad.com/
    - Existing datasets: http://ocds.stage.aptivate.org/opendatacomparison/datasets/


Data Landscape
---------------
    
Creating an overall understanding about the types and format of existing
published contracting data.

Sprint goals:

    - Classification of Dataset Fields
      We want to classify each field/column in our various datasets into 
      "buckets" that build a picture of the sort of data we have available.
      Sub goals:
        - Manually classify many fields
        - Find the feasability of doing it with supervised machine learning
        - Explore unspervised clustering
    - Build visualization of the landscape

Data Comparison
---------------

    The data comparison is a site based on open-comparison.  Our goals are to
    make it useable to find and compare datasets.

    - Bugfixing
    - Make community usable
